## What is Bundling-Minification?

These two optimization techniques are widely used in modern web development processes and help increase the competitiveness of websites.

### What is Bundling?
Bundling is an optimization method that reduces download time by combining multiple files at the same time. Bundling creates a smaller number of larger files. In this way, all resources are downloaded in a single HTTP request, reducing the loading time of the web page. All the CSS and JavaScript code required for the web application is collected in a single file, so users can view the page faster.

### What is Minification?
Minification is a process used to optimize the source code files of a web application. This process edits code such as CSS, JavaScript and HTML to remove unnecessary characters, spaces and line breaks. It shortens variable names and transforms the code to take up less space without affecting functionality.
